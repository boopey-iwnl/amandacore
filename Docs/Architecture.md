# Architecture Overview

## Goals

- Build original AmandaCore MMO behavior through shared, server-authoritative simulation rules.
- Keep engine integration thin so gameplay logic remains project-owned and portable.
- Support server-authoritative multiplayer from the beginning.
- Use original AmandaCore content and clean-room architecture notes instead of copied internals or compatibility artifacts.
- Support a real login flow with launcher, account services, character selection, realm routing, and world join tickets.
- Keep all gameplay protocols, schemas, command names, content IDs, formulas, and assets AmandaCore-original.

## High-level split

### Shared domain

`Shared/AmandaCoreShared` holds data contracts and rule evaluators that must stay consistent across client and server:

- Movement stepping and tunable locomotion constants.
- Combat resolution, mitigation, and outcome generation.
- Threat state evaluation for simple AI transitions.
- Quest objective progress rules.
- Loot table rolling and content validation helpers.
- Client/server message shapes, session/bootstrap types, realm descriptors, character summaries, and world join tickets.

### Launcher and services

The monorepo now includes a practical local/dev platform slice:

- `Client/Launcher/AmandaCore.Launcher`: Windows-first launcher for register/login, realm selection, character management, and join ticket handoff.
- `Services/cmd/auth-service`: register, login, refresh, logout, password change, and password recovery start.
- `Services/cmd/account-service`: authenticated account profile access.
- `Services/cmd/realm-service`: realm directory and patch manifest.
- `Services/cmd/character-service`: character listing and creation.
- `Services/cmd/world-service`: world join ticket issuance.
- `Services/cmd/admin-service`: account listing, bans, and role assignment.

These services currently share a file-backed state store for local/dev/staging execution. The long-term deployment target remains database/cache-backed multi-service infrastructure.

### Runtime Gems

Each Gem has a single, durable responsibility:

- `GameCore`: bootstrap, session orchestration, game state machine, and service registry.
- `MovementPhysics`: movement controllers, prediction, and server correction adapters.
- `CombatRules`: gameplay event application and combat presentation hooks.
- `StatsProgression`: stat curves, derived stats, and level progression.
- `InventoryLoot`: inventory runtime, item equipment, vendors, and drop flows.
- `QuestRuntime`: quest acceptance, tracking, completion, and UI feeds.
- `NpcAi`: behavior trees/state machines, leash handling, and encounter ownership.
- `ZoneStreaming`: outdoor cell streaming, world partitioning, and micro-instance handoff.
- `UiClient`: HUD, chat, targeting, hotbars, and player feedback.
- `NetClient`: transport, serialization, interpolation, and prediction feeds.
- `NetServer`: authority, replication, interest management, and session hosting.
- `Persistence`: save/load, profile state, and content version migration.
- `ContentTools`: authoring validators, packaging, and reference replay comparison.

### Content model

The data model is deliberately wider than the first slice so future work can scale without a rewrite. JSON Schema definitions live in `Content/Schemas/gameplay.schema.json`, and example authored content lives in `Content/GameData/ZoneSlice`.

## Recommended future O3DE wiring

- Build `AmandaCoreShared` as a normal static library and link it into both client and server Gems.
- Keep Atom, Terrain, Prefabs, and networking as engine services underneath project-owned gameplay systems.
- Place O3DE serialization wrappers around the shared domain types instead of moving game rules into engine-specific components.
- Use Prefab and asset metadata for presentation. Use project-owned JSON or generated asset products for authoritative gameplay data.

## Networking model

- Client sends intent: movement inputs, ability requests, target changes, and quest interactions.
- Server simulates the canonical world state using the same domain rules and publishes snapshots.
- Client performs prediction and interpolation but always accepts authoritative corrections.
- Domain message and snapshot shapes are defined in `AmandaCoreShared/Messages.h` so alternate transports or backends can adapt without rewriting gameplay code.

## Server-authoritative NPC combat loop

The current server slice includes an original dev hostile NPC archetype, `dev_isle_stalker`, spawned as `Isle Stalker` for combat validation. Players can select the NPC, use the original `dev_basic_strike` ability, receive authoritative damage and cooldown results, kill the NPC, receive persisted kill credit, and observe server-scheduled respawn.

The world response exposes protocol-neutral state diffs for entity spawn, health, combat state, target selection, ability results, death, and progression. These are internal AmandaCore contracts, not copied packet or emulator surfaces.

## Clean-room reference boundary

This implementation uses original AmandaCore code and data. TrinityCore/AzerothCore were used only as high-level architectural reference. No source code, SQL, packet layouts, opcodes, command names, schemas, content IDs, scripts, assets, formulas, or stat tables were copied or adapted.

## Milestone one slice

- One outdoor zone with two streamable cells and one micro-instance hook.
- One player archetype, two hostile enemy archetypes, one vendor-type NPC, and a short quest chain.
- Traversal, combat, objective progression, loot, vendor, respawn, persistence seams, and chat support.
